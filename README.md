## Overview

We have come up with a public voting system where the voting could be transparent, secure and trustable.



## Problem

 Everything in this world is available online but even now we have to go to a polling center and wait in a queue for 3–4 hours to cast our vote?
It’s weird. Isn’t it?

Majority thinks its the security .
But what if Blockchain could fundamentally change that?

## Solution
Using Ethereum as block chain we tried to solve this problem. So we have an App where the govt entity can register themselves .
